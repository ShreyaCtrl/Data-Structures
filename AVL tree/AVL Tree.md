# AVL Tree Implementation in Python

## Introduction

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree where the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees is at most one. This ensures that the tree remains balanced, resulting in efficient search and insertion operations.

## Implementation Details

The provided Python code implements an AVL tree with the following key components:

### Node Class:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, parent):
        self.data = data
        self.parent = parent
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.height = self.find_height()
        # self.balance_factor = self._balance_factor()
```

- Each node in the tree is represented by an instance of the `Node` class.
- The `data` attribute stores the value associated with the node.
- The `parent` attribute points to the parent node of the current node.
- The `left` and `right` attributes point to the left and right child nodes, respectively.
- The `height` attribute stores the height of the subtree rooted at the current node.
- The `balance_factor` attribute stores the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees.

### AVLTree Class:

```python
class AVLTree:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.root = Node(data, None)
```

- The `AVLTree` class represents the AVL tree itself.
- It initializes with a root node containing the provided `data`.

### Insertion Operation:

```python
def insert_bst(self, root, data):
    # print(data)
    self.root = self._insert_bst(self.root, data)
    # print('slkfj')
    root = self.search(self.root, data)
    # print('passing', root.data)
    self.balance_insert(root, data)
    # self.print_helper(avl.root, '    ', True)
    root.height = root.find_height()
    # print(self.root.data)
    return root
```

- The `insert_bst` method inserts a new node with the given `data` into the AVL tree.
- It first calls the `_insert_bst` method to

### Balance Insertion Operation

The balance_insert method is called after a new node has been inserted into the AVL tree to ensure that the tree remains balanced. It calculates the balance factor of a node and performs rotations if the balance factor exceeds the allowed limits.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the balance_insert method:

- Calculate the height and balance factor of the root node.
- If the balance factor is greater than 1, it means that the left subtree is heavier than the right subtree. In this case, we need to check if the left child's balance factor is negative, which indicates that the left-left (LL) rotation is required. If the left child's balance factor is positive, we need to perform a right-left (RL) rotation.
- If the balance factor is less than -1, it means that the right subtree is heavier than the left subtree. In this case, we need to check if the right child's balance factor is positive, which indicates that the right-right (RR) rotation is required. If the right child's balance factor is negative, we need to perform a left-right (LR) rotation.
- After performing the rotation, we need to update the balance factor and height of the affected nodes.
- If the parent of the current node is not None, we need to recursively call the balance_insert method for the parent node.
- If the balance_insert method is called for the root node and the balance factor is not 0, we need to update the root node of the AVL tree.
- By performing these rotations, the balance_insert method ensures that the AVL tree remains balanced even after inserting new nodes.

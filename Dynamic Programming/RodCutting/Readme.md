# Rod Cutting Problem Documentation

## Problem Description:
The Rod Cutting problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. Given a rod of length 'n' and a price list for different lengths of the rod, the goal is to determine the maximum revenue that can be obtained by cutting the rod into pieces and selling them according to their lengths' prices.

## Intuition:
The intuition behind solving the Rod Cutting problem using dynamic programming is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems and store the solutions to these subproblems in a memoization table. By doing so, we avoid recomputing solutions for the same subproblems multiple times, leading to improved efficiency.

## Approach:
1. **Memoization**:
   - The `memoizedCutRod` method initializes arrays for storing revenue and cut information for each rod length.
   - It calls the `memoizedCutRodAuxiliary` method, which recursively calculates the optimal revenue for each rod length using memoization.
   - The `memoizedCutRodAuxiliary` method checks if the revenue for a given length has already been computed and stored in the memoization table. If so, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it calculates the optimal revenue by considering all possible cuts and recursively solving subproblems.
   - The optimal revenue and cut information are stored in the memoization table for future use.

2. **Printing Cutting Solution**:
   - The `printCuttingSolution` method uses the memoization approach to print the optimal cutting solution for the rod.
   - It iteratively determines the optimal cut length for each piece of the rod and prints the corresponding information.

## Complexity Analysis:
- Time Complexity: 
  - The time complexity of the memoized approach is O(n^2), where 'n' is the length of the rod. This is because for each rod length, we consider all possible cuts, leading to nested iterations.
- Space Complexity:
  - The space complexity is O(n), as we use arrays to store memoization information for each rod length.

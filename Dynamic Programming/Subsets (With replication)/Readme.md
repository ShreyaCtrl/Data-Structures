## Problem description
Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible
subsets
(the power set).

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]


## Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10

-10 <= nums[i] <= 10

## Explaination
The code for generating subsets with duplicates can be explained in terms of dynamic programming (DP) concepts, specifically using a bottom-up approach. Here's how:

1. **Subproblem Identification**:
    - In this problem, the subproblem can be defined as generating subsets for a smaller array. If we have subsets for `n` elements, we can use that information to generate subsets for `n+1` elements.

2. **Base Case Initialization**:
    - The base case here is an empty subset, which is added initially to `finalAnswer`.

3. **Build Up Solutions**:
    - The outer loop iterates through each element in the sorted `nums` array.
    - For each element, the inner loop iterates through the existing subsets up to the current size.
    - It creates a new subset by adding the current element to each existing subset, effectively building up solutions for larger subsets based on solutions for smaller subsets.

4. **Memoization**:
    - In dynamic programming, memoization involves storing intermediate results to avoid redundant computations. In this code, the `finalAnswer` list serves as a memoization table.
    - Before adding a new subset to `finalAnswer`, the code checks if it already exists in the list (`if (!finalAnswer.contains(subset))`). This check prevents duplicate subsets from being added, acting as a form of memoization to avoid recomputing subsets that have already been generated.

5. **Optimal Substructure**:
    - The optimal substructure property in DP states that an optimal solution to a larger problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. In this case, each subset generated is optimal in the sense that it includes unique elements and contributes to the final set of all possible subsets.

Overall, while the code doesn't use traditional DP constructs like memoization tables or recursive function calls, it embodies the principles of DP by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, building solutions incrementally, and avoiding redundant computations through subset checking. This approach leads to an efficient solution for generating subsets with duplicates.

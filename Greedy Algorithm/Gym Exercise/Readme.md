## Problem description

1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `energy`: An integer representing your initial energy level.
   - `N`: An integer representing the number of exercises available in the gym.
   - `exercises`: An array of integers where each element represents the amount of energy drained by a specific exercise.

2. **Objective**:
   Your goal is to perform a series of exercises in such a way that your energy level reaches zero or becomes negative (i.e., you get tired). However, there are some constraints and rules to follow:
   - You can perform each exercise at most two times because others also need to use the machines.
   - You want to find the minimum number of unique exercises (performed either once or twice) required to deplete your energy.
   - If it's not possible to get tired by performing all exercises, you should return -1.

3. **Approach**:
   - You start by sorting the exercises in non-increasing order based on the energy they drain. This sorting helps prioritize exercises that drain more energy.
   - Then, you iterate through the sorted exercises and perform each exercise up to two times if possible, subtracting the energy drained from your total energy each time.
   - You keep track of the number of exercises performed. If your energy reaches zero or below during this process, you return the count of exercises performed as the minimum number required to get tired.
   - If after trying all exercises you still have energy remaining, it means it's not possible to get tired with the given exercises, so you return -1.

4. **Example**:
   Let's consider an example input:
   - Initial energy: 6
   - Number of exercises: 3
   - Exercises: [2, 1, 2]
   
   The sorted list of exercises would be [2, 2, 1]. You can perform the first exercise twice, which reduces your energy to 2. Then you can perform the second exercise once, reducing your energy to 0. In total, you performed 3 exercises. Thus, the output for this example would be 3.

This problem combines elements of optimization and constraint handling, requiring you to devise a strategy to maximize the use of energy while respecting the limits imposed by the number of times each exercise can be performed. The greedy approach of selecting exercises based on their energy drain in descending order typically leads to an efficient solution.

    "Code for 8 types of imbalances in trees using deepcopy :\n",
    "- Code is using deepcopy extensively to create copies of nodes. This approach is not typical in red-black tree implementations, and it can be computationally expensive. Instead, most red-black tree implementations use node pointer manipulation to perform rotations and updates. If you're using deepcopy to handle these cases, it may not work as expected, and it could lead to incorrect results."

This is where Red Black Trees come in, they are a type of balanced binary search tree that use a specific set of rules to ensure that the tree is always balanced. This balance guarantees that the time complexity for operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching is always O(log n), regardless of the initial shape of the tree."
